# ChatEmojis
Chat Emojis is a lightweight plugin that replaces emoticons with 'emojis'.
ChatEmojis allows you to add your own emojis in the config file and supports multiple emoticons, random emoji selection, and regular expression capturing. Chat Emojis comes with 36 default emojis including all of the emojis on Hypixel.

**Required Java Version:** Java 8+

# Commands
| Command                | Description | Permission |
|------------------------| ------ | ------ |
| `/emoji [list] [page]` | Shows list of emojis | `chatemojis.list` |
| `/emoji help`          | Shows list of commands | none |
| `/emoji reload`        | Reloads all emojis | `chatemojis.reload` |
| `/emoji version`       | Shows the plugin's version | none |
| `/emoji settings`      | Shows list of emojis | `chatemojis.admin` |

# Permissions
| Permission Node | Default | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| chatemojis.list | Everyone | Allowes access to use /emoji [list] |
| chatemojis.use.* | OP | Permission to use all emojis |
| chatemojis.reload | OP | Allowes access to reload emojis |
| chatemojis.admin | OP | Allowes access to change plugin settings |
| chatemojis.* | OP | Permission to use all emojis and /emoji command |

**Emoji-Specific Permission**:
Ungrouped emojis permission is as easy as `chatemojis.use.<name>`
Grouped emojis permission needs to include the path to the group (ex. `chatemojis.use.<group-path>.<name>`)
If you still don't understand how to get emoji-specific permission- as a server operator you're able to hover over the emoji (in the `/emoji` list) to view the permission node for that specific emoji.

# Dependencies
ChatEmojis does not hard-depend on any other plugins; Meaning **none** of these dependencies are required for ChatEmojis to work.
- **[PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/)** is used for placeholder parsing.
- **[EssentialsX](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/essentialsx.9089/)** is used for parsing emoticons in direct messages.

Please note that if you are using PlaceholderAPI, you must also install the PlaceholderAPI Extension corresponding to the placeholder you're trying to access, more about this can be found [here](https://github.com/PlaceholderAPI/PlaceholderAPI/wiki/Placeholders).

# For Developers
If you want to parse emojis in your own plugin you can use the ChatEmojis API.
You need to add ChatEmojis as a dependency in your plugin's `pom.xml` file:
```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>RMJTromp</id>
        <url>https://repo.rmjtromp.com/</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>

<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.rmjtromp</groupId>
        <artifactId>ChatEmojis</artifactId>
        <version>2.4.2</version> <!-- Update this version to the latest one -->
        <scope>provided</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

You can then use ChatEmojis' instance to call the parse method:
```java
import com.rmjtromp.chatemojis.ChatEmojis;

ChatEmojis chatEmojis = (ChatEmojis) Bukkit.getPluginManager().getPlugin("ChatEmojis");

Player player = null; // the player who the message is being parsed for
String message = "..."; // the message to parse
boolean force = player.isOp(); // whether to force parsing regardless of permissions

String parsedMessage = chatEmojis.parseEmojis(player, message, force);
```
